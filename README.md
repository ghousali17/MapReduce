# MapReduce

This repository is for my experiments with MapRedcuce in Hadoop 2.7.0. The repository is divded into different folders, each for a unique 
MapReduce program. 

## WordCount
 This contains code for calculating the word counts, the word pair counts (bigram count) and bigram relative frequencies.
 
 ## ParallelDijkstra
 This contains code for calculating all the possible shortest paths from a single source node. Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented as a 
 greedy Breadth First Search since we have worked under the assumption that the data might be too large for a single computer to process.
 
 
 ## PageRank
 This contains code for calculating the page rank of some users on a social media site. All users are represented as nodes and their 
 connection as edges in a graph.
